## README

The aim of this project is to obtain UCE loci from 30 different specimens of the gall associated doryctine wasps (Hymenoptera: Braconidae) for phylogenetic reconstruction. 

Data where obtained from sonicated DNA extractions that where employed for library preparation. The enrichment of pooled libraries was performed using two kits of different bait versions designed specifically for the Hymenoptera order. The probe sets target 1510 and 2590 UCE loci.

This repository contains the following subfolders:

+ Raw data: Includes the FASTQ files of the 30 specimens

+ Command line: Text files with the instructions for processing the data in PHYLUCE. This includes sequence trimming and obtaining of UCE loci, matrix alignment, filtering.

+ UCE processing: Derived files from the PHYLUCE software procedure, including log and conf files 

+ Phylogenetic analysis: Includes the final topology derived from a rapid RAxML analysis
